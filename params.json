The T (or TKey) must implement the IEquatable interface, so you can use any object you want but remember the dependency.\r\n\r\n##Why use it?\r\nI need frequently a common type for my entities for generic repositories and abstract methods for CRUD operations and I thought you need too.\r\n\r\n##Who needs it?\r\nAnyone that wants to create abstract code and generics, working on DAL is not only DbContext and EF.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
